<h1>Rental Jobcenter Checker</h1>


<b>Rental Jobcenter Checker</b> is a program designed to assist in determining the conformity of a rental apartment to set limits, considering the number of occupants and various financial parameters. The program allows users to input information about the number of occupants, rent, number of rooms, and various additional expenses such as utilities and water. Based on the input data, the program checks whether the apartment meets the set limits, including maximum rent, number of rooms, additional expenses, and the amount of deposit. If the apartment does not meet the limits, the program provides information about the exceeding limits and indicates the necessary adjustments.

This program is ideal for tenants who want to ensure that the chosen apartment fits within their financial capabilities and room requirements. It can also be useful for real estate agents, helping them quickly identify suitable options for their clients.
